<h1>The best movies according to chike</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Stranger things</h3>
</p>
I enjoyed the fact that this movie is an all teen based movie<br /> 
with great acting skillsets.<br />
<p>
<h3>When they see us</h3>
<p>
Here's another great teen movie that tells us about<br /> 
a true life story of how a couple of teens were falsely accused<br />
and framed for a murder they knew nothing about, just because <br />
they were black kids living in a white neighbourhood.<br /> 
Great movie to bring about awareness of false accusation/framing<br />
in the corrupt system of justice.<br />
</p>
<h3>Lucifer</h3>
<p>
Love the conception of how the directors of this movie portray<br />
the human existence in relation to the divine.<br /> 
Great characters too.<br />
